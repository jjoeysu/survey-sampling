# survey-sampling
简单随机抽样，分层抽样，比估计与回归估计，二重抽样，整群抽样，设计效应，置信区间相关的函数
This is my coursework for the survey sampling course, partly adapted from my teacher's functions, and contains various functions for sampling estimation.
Each file and the object indicated by the function is marked in the 'function list' file.
If you have open book exams, this can help you to a great extent, saving you a lot of exam time and increasing your efficiency in doing the questions.
